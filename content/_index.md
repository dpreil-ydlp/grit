## I've Been Where You Are

In 2018, I was running a real estate investment platform with a complex dual pipeline - sourcing deals while attracting investors. On paper, we were successful. Behind the scenes? **I was drowning in 70+ hour weeks, constantly firefighting, with everything running through me.**

That's when I discovered how to apply enterprise-level operational strategies to small teams. Not heavy bureaucracy - the intelligent systems, people strategies, and planning rhythms that actually work.

**The result?** Within 6 months:
- Got 25+ hours per week back for strategic work
- Eliminated 90% of operational mistakes  
- Team operated smoothly without constant intervention
- Scaled revenue while working less, not more

**I learned that great operations isn't about more processâ€”it's about the right systems and the right people.**
