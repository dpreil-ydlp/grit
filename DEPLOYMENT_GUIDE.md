## üöÄ Next Steps for Deployment

### Option 1: Deploy to Netlify (Recommended)
1. Push this repository to GitHub
2. Connect to Netlify
3. Build command: `hugo --gc --minify`
4. Publish directory: `public`
5. Environment: `HUGO_VERSION = 0.147.9`

### Option 2: Manual Hugo Build
```bash
# Install Hugo (if not installed)
brew install hugo

# Build the site
hugo --gc --minify

# The `public/` directory contains your deployable site
```

## üîß Development Server (Local Testing)

Due to template reference issues in the current setup, the easiest way to test locally is:

hugo --buildDrafts

# Or use a simple HTTP server
python -m http.server 8000 --directory public
```
